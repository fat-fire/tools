# Tools to run very simple portfolio simulations

There are two notebook files. 
[Iterative growth calculator](Growth-Calculator--iterative-algorithm.ipynb) 
and an 
[exponential growth calculator](Growth-Calculator--exponention-algorithm.ipynb)
They both calculate the same thing which is given some initial values they 
predict how a fund or ETF will grow. 

The exponential growth calculator is simple
enough it would probably be better suited to a spreadsheet but in the future
it may be enahnced to be more meaningful.

The simulations are run using [jupyter notebook](https://jupyter.org/)
